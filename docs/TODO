1. main.py
Multiple import statements for the same modules (e.g., logging, tkinter, pytesseract, etc.) are present, which is not a good practice.
The function get_training_choice(gui) contains print statements like print("break 1"), which might be leftover debug statements.
The function train_ocr(gui, progress_value) is called with a progress_value that is not used within the function.
The function perform_ocr(image_path) is defined but not used within main.py.
The function test_ocr_export() is called but does not seem to have a practical application in the main logic.
The function update_gui(gui, data_queue) tries to unpack three values from data_queue.get_nowait(), but it's not guaranteed that three values will always be available in the queue.
The function main() initializes and starts threads but does not handle thread termination or errors during thread execution.
2. src/Training.py
The function draw_bounding_box(event, x, y, flags, param) uses a global variable image_copy which might not be the best practice.
The function advanced_ocr_processing(ocr_text) defines a regex pattern but does not seem to be used within the script.
The function perform_ocr_and_annotation() uses a global variable image_copy and does not handle potential issues with file I/O operations safely.
The function main() is defined but does not seem to have a practical application in the script.
3. src/csv_exporter.py
This file only contains logging setup and does not define or perform any functionality.
4. src/data_processing.py
The function perform_ocr(image_path) is defined but not used within the script.
The function process_ocr_results(text, screenshot_file_path, csv_file_path) does not return a value, which might be an issue since it's expected to return a value in main.py.
5. src/gui.py
The function update_progress_bar(self, value) is defined three times, which is not valid and will result in only the last definition being used.
The function run(self) is defined but not used within the script.
The function update_text_box_with_csv_data(self, file_path) does not handle potential issues with file I/O operations safely.
6. src/screenshot_dnd.py
The function screenshot_dnd_left_half() does not handle potential issues with file I/O operations safely.
The function open_captured_image() is defined but not used within the script.
General Observations:
There is no clear loop for OCR scanning in the provided code, which might be the reason why it's not looping through OCR scans.
Exception handling is present but does not provide a recovery mechanism or user notification in the GUI.
The code lacks comments explaining the logic, making it a bit challenging to understand the intended functionality and flow.
Recommendations:
Ensure that the OCR loop is defined and controlled correctly in the main logic.
Implement a clear and user-friendly notification mechanism for errors and exceptions.
Refactor the code to avoid using global variables and ensure that functions are defined and used correctly.
Add comments and documentation to explain the code logic and flow.
